Not really a hike, but we had our walks for sure!

We really had to disconnect and spend some time on the fresh air and to reconnect with the nature 🦅
<!--truncate-->
This walk was the longest we took:

It was four of us - wife and both girls (I was carrying the baby). We took a chairlift ride from the center of Kopaonik village (worth visiting if you're hungry or thirsty), which was a mind blowing experience for our older girl (7), since she never took such ride before 😵 After reaching the 🏞 [Pančić's peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan%C4%8Di%C4%87%27s_Peak), I saw guys from the Mountain Search and Rescue team and asked if they new the best way to reach the [Nebeske stolice](https://goo.gl/maps/dntHefYrzkeRE5Ez8) lookout (1.788m), and were given precise instructions 💪🏼

After a while, we were stunned by the view! Check it out :

It wasn't only this one we had. There were many others, but rather shorter ones.

After changing the accommodation, we discovered there was another peak called Treska (1.622m) that only wife and older girl conquered 🎖 🎖 My excuse was that I was gonna stay with the baby hahah 😁🤷‍♂️

We also visited the [Gobelja ridge](https://goo.gl/maps/NA12GvuPkspaQu8k7) (1.934m) and it was beautiful 🏞 We also stumbled upon some kind of a shelter near the peak:
